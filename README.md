# PhysicsSim
A physics simulator for curved space

This is may local version of the boilerplate code Steve created based on the paper.

I plan to try and integrate what I have been working on in Mathematica and Python so that it can be more accessible through the visualization of html as well as make the integration into the curved spaces more streamlined.

I am hoping that the performance of JavaScript will be appropriate to run the dynamics in realtime. If not, I have some optimizations to hopefully help things along.
